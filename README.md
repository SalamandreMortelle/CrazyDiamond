# Crazy Diamond
A desktop application for 2D Optics

Build a 2D environment with optical components using a simple drag & drop User Interface, add light sources and simulate
light propagation through the system.

Group optical components with rotational symmetry in a Centered Optical System and study them using first-order (Gaussian)
optics : cardinal elements of the Centered System are located, as well as aperture stop, field stop, and ABCD matrix.

## Features
 - Simple optical components with different surface curvature models : plane, spherical, conic
 - Combination of any optical components with Constructive Solid Geometry (intersection, unions, difference, symmetrical difference)
 - Reflective, absorbant, transparent or semi-transparent surfaces
 - Polarizing surface (experimental)
 - Different light sources : point source, conic beam, parallel beam
 - Linearly polarized light (experimental)
 - Propagation using Descarte's laws (reflection, refraction)
 - Calculation of light intensity
 - Fresnel equations to calculate intensity of polarized light
 - Centered Optical System :
   - ABCD matrix
   - Location of focal planes, principal planes, and odal planes (cardinal elements)
   - Location of the image plane
   - Power (vergence) 
 - Environment save & load
